### Music deConsolidator

MdCR is a simple Python script that de-consolidates iTunes/Music library. It moves all the music files into one folder and adds the artist name to the filename.

### Warning! Attention!
**Please create a backup of your music before running the script. The script removes the files from origin and is irreversible.**

### How to use
Before running the script please edit RootDir and NewDir parameters to your liking.
